# What's this?

This is [kickstarter/ios-oss](https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss) style ViewModel template which uses [ReactiveX/RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) instead of [ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift).

You can install this template with only one command and use it on your Xcode.

# Install

```
$ ./install.sh
```

# Usage

1. Open a Xcode project.
2. File > New > File...
3. Select ViewModel in RxKickstarter section 
4. Type class name without "ViewModel", for example, you type "Hoge" and Xcode makes HogeViewModel.swift
